Hello! 

Thank you for downloading Warp Pads v1.2! I've poured my heart and soul into this, so I hope you like it!

This version of the data pack has been tested to work on Minecraft versions 1.14.4-1.15.2. Certain features *will not work* in 1.16 until updated.

Usage:

To create a warp pad, throw a golden apple and 4 quartz on top of a gold block. This has a maximum radius of 1000 blocks.
For tier 2 warp pads, throw a ghast tear and 4 phantom membranes on top of an emerald block. This has a maximum radius of 5000 blocks.
For tier 3 warp pads, throw a nether star and 4 ender pearls on top of a diamond block. This has no maximum distance.

To name a warp pad, either name the golden apple (or other item for other tiers) prior to creating the warp pad.
To rename a warp pad, throw a named piece of paper on top of the warp pad after it has already been created.

To change the color of the warp pad icon, throw a dye on top of the warp pad.
To change the "warp stream frequency", throw a redstone on top of a warp pad.*
To make a warp pad private, throw a diamond on top of the ward pad.*

*Note: Diamonds and Redstone thrown on a warp pad will be dropped if the warp pad is broken.

Installation:

Place the zipped file in the "world\datapacks" folder on your server or in your Minecraft saves (located at C:\Users\[user]\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\saves\[worldname]\datapacks). 
Either restart the world or server, or run /reload. The pack will announce to all players in chat: "Warp Pads has loaded" if it successfully loaded.
